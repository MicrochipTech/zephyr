      - PWM_BBLED_CLK_AHB: Clock source is the PLL based AHB clock
      - PWM_BBLED_CLK_SLOW: Clock source is the PLL based PCR slow clock
      - PWM_BBLED_CLK_32K: Clock source is the 32KHz domain

    description: |
      Used to gates off 32K clock and turn off LEDs during sleep.
      This applicable only to 32K clock, because in 48MHz clock
      will be always turned off in low power by PCR.
