    girqs:
      type: array

      description: |
        An array of integers encoding each interrupt signal connection.
        This information includes the aggregated GIRQ number, GIRQ bit
        position, aggregated GIRQ NVIC connection, and direct NVIC
        connection of the GIRQ bit.

      type: array
      required: true
      description: |
        A two entry integer array containing the QMSPI PCR sleep register
        index and bit position.

      required: true

    pinctrl-names:
      required: true

    dmas:
      description: |
        Optional TX & RX dma specifiers.  Each specifier will have a phandle
        reference to the dmac controller, the channel number, and peripheral
        trigger source.

        For example dmas for TX, RX on GPSPI
           dmas = <&dmac 0 12>, <&dmac 1 13>;

    dma-names:
      description: |
        Required if the dmas property exists.  This should be "tx" and "rx"
        to match the dmas property.

        For example
           dma-names = "tx", "rx";
