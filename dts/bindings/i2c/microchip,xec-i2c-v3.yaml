      XEC I2C controller has a hardware MUX to select among
      multiple I2C ports. I2C pins must be set to their I2C
      mode using PINCTRL. The driver can then select the pins
      by programming the port select register field in the
      controller's configuration register.

      I2C controller versions older than v3.8 do not make pin
      state monitoring visible in the bit-bang register without
      switching the pins from I2C control to bit-bang control.
      This can cause disruption of an open I2C session. For older
      hardware use access pin state using the GPIO driver.
