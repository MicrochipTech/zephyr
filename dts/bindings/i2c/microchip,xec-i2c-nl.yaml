    description: |
      I2C-NL hardware requires the layout: target I2C address, data,
      and optional repeated start I2C address. The driver uses a buffer
      to build the packet. The size specified by cm-buffer-size is padded
      by 4 to provide space for start and repeated start addresses. Maximum
      size is limited to 0xFFFC bytes.

  tm-rx-buffer-size:
    type: int
    description: |
      Target mode receive buffer for storing data written by the external I2C
      host controller. Default size is 8 bytes. Maximum size is limited to
      0xFFFC bytes.
