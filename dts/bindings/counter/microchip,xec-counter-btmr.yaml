    description: |
      XEC basic timers input frequency is 48 MHz. Counter rate is
      scaled down using a prescaler.

  prescaler:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      XEC basic timers implement a 16-bit prescaler used to derive
      the counter frequency.
      Count frequency = clock_freq / (prescaler + 1)

  alarm-timer:
    type: phandle
    required: true
    description: |
      A handle to another basic timer hardware node for use as
      the alarm timer in the counter driver. This node does
      not need a driver only a binding describing its properties.

  max-value:
    type: int
    description: |
      Maximum counter value. XEC basic timers are implemented with
      either a 16 or 32 bit counter.
