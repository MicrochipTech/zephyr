child-binding:
  description: |
    Child node containing the routing of an eSPI virtual wire to the SoC
    VW registers and ECIA GIRQ registers.
  properties:
    source-bit:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Position in the virtual wire group of 4 signals. Allowd values are
        0 to 3. Default values are based upon eSPI version 1.5 specification.

    vw-group:
      type: phandle
      required: true
      description: |
        Phandle to the virtual wire group containing this signal.

        Example: eSPI SLP_S3 is source 0 in the group mapped to CTVW00 registers
          vw-group = <&ctvw00>;

    irq-sel:
      type: string
      default: "disabled"
      description: |
        Controller to Target virtual wires can generate an interrupt to EC.
        This field selects edge or level mode.
      enum:
        - "disabled"
        - "level low"
        - "level high"
        - "rising edge"
        - "falling edge"
        - "both edges"

    reset-state:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Value (0 or 1) loaded into the virtual wire by hardware when the
        group's configured reset event occurs.

    vw-name:
      type: string
      required: true
      description: |
        The last part of the virtual wire signal name from the zephyr
        espi driver header file. This property is appended with an
        underscore to ESPI_VWIRE_SIGNAL to create the enumerated type
        value name.
