    Child node containing eSPI Peripheral Channel device Host properties
  properties:
    ldn:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: Host device logical device number.

    host-io-config-index:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Hardware host configuration index of the I/O BAR.
        The index is an 8-bit unsigned value. Refer to eSPI I/O
        base address register tables in the data sheet. A value of 0
        indicates logical device does not implement an I/O BAR.

    host-mem-config-index:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Hardware host configuration index of the memory BAR.
        The index is an 8-bit unsigned value. Refer to eSPI memory
        base base address register table in the data sheet. A value of 0
        indicates the logical device does not implement a memory BAR.

    host-address:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Host address the logical device appears at. On x86 systems this
        address may be I/O or memory space. Address values are interpreted
        as: 0 = disabled, [1, 0xffff] I/O space, [0x10000, UINT32_MAX]
        memory space.

    sirq-config-indexes:
      type: array
      description: |
        Array of chip specific configuration register index values for
        Serial-IRQ slot value. These values are constant for the chip.
        Refer to the eSPI Serial-IRQ assignement table in the data sheet.
        This array should have two entries. If a peripheral does not implement
        Serial-IRQs the value(s) should be 0.

    sirqs:
      type: array
      description: |
        Host Serial IRQ numbers assigned to the Serial-IRQ slots the device
        implements. A value of 255 indicates the slot is disabled.

        Example: KBC implements two Serial IRQ slots for keyboard and mouse
                 host interrupts. We map them to Serial-IRQ slots 1 and 12.
          sirqs = <1 12>;
        Example: UART0 implements one Serial IRQ slot at hardware index 9.
          sirqs = <3>;

    sirq-names:
      type: string-array
      description: |
        Names for the provided Serial IRQs. The number of names needs to match the
        number of sirqs.
