  qspi_descriptors:
    type: array
    description: |
      QSPI requires 16 32-bit descriptors describing the
      SPI commands TAF uses to communicate with the flash
      device(s). Refer to Microchip eSPI data sheets for
      determining the descriptor values. NOTE: values
      do depend upon the specific flash devices.
