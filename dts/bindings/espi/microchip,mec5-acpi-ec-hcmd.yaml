      ACPI_EC data register size is defined as one byte. Add this boolean to
      configure the data register to be four bytes. When four byte mode is
      enabled the IBF bit is cleared by the host reading data byte 3. The
      Host memory or I/O address should be at least 4-byte aligned when this
      mode is enabled.
