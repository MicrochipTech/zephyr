child-binding:
  description: |
    Child node containing eSPI SRAM BARs hardware. SRAM BAR allows
    mapping of a section of EC SRAM to the Host address space.
  properties:
    id:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Zero based SRAM BAR identification.

    host-address-lsw:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Low 32-bits of the Host address the EC SRAM can be accessed at.

    region-base:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Base address of the EC SRAM being mapped. Hardware requires the
        address to aligned with the SRAM region size.

    region-size:
      type: string
      required: true
      description: |
        Region size is powers of 2 from 0 to 15 creating regions from 1
        byte to 32KB. Note: hardware enforces region base address to
        be aligned on the size.
