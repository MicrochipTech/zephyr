      type: array
      description: |
        Host Serial IRQ numbers assigned to this device. A value of 255
        disables SIRQ genaration.

        Example: Mailbox implements two Serial IRQ slots.
          sirqs = <13 14>;
        Example: UART implements one Serial IRQ slot.
          sirqs = <3>;
