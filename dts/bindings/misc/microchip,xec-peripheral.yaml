      XEC peripherals with interrupt capability route their interrupt
      signal(s) through the EC Interrupt Aggregator (ECIA). The peripheral
      interrupt signal(s) and corresponding enables in the ECIA GIRQ are
      combined to produce a result signal. Most result signals are connected
      directly to the Cortex-M NVIC. Each peripheral with interrupts needs
      the ECIA GIRQ number(s) and bit position(s).
