      GIRQ allows its source to be routed directly to the ARM NVIC.
      If this properity is not present the GIRQ HW implementation
      cannot connect its interrupt sources individually to the NVIC.
      Instead all sources are wire-OR'd together producing one input
      to the NVIC. The ISR must scan all GIRQ result bits (OR of source
      and enable) and handle each active result bit.
