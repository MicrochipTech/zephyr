    type: array
    description:  |
        I3C1(secondary host) boot as Target by default.
        This property shall be used to set Provisioned ID (PID)
        value for the Target. 48bit required to hold PID.
            Ex., PID -> 0xB0123456789B
                 i3c1-as-tgt-pid = < 0xB012 0x3456789B >

  i3c1-as-tgt-pid-random:
    type: boolean
    description:  |
        I3C1(secondary host) boot as Target by default.
        This property shall be used to set PID Radom value for the Target.
        True if lower 32-bit of Provisioned ID is random.
        This sets the bit 32 of Provisioned ID which means, the lower
        32-bit is random value.

    type: int
    description:  |
        I3C1(secondary host) boot as Target by default.
        This property shall be used to set Target maximum read length(MRL).

    type: int
    description:  |
        I3C1(secondary host) boot as Target by default.
        This property shall be used to set Target maximum write length(MWL).
