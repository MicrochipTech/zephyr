    description: |
      Delay in units of 10 ns from CS# de-assertion to CS# assertion.
      If not present use hardware default value of 6.

  ctrl-taps:
    type: array
    description: |
      An array of integers representing the control tap points for
      each of the two chip selects. Each value is in [0, 255]. 0 is HW default.
      This property may only be required for 96 MHz operation and is
      board layout dependent. Refer to the data sheet for control tap description.
