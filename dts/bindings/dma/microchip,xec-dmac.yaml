# #dma-cells : Must be <2>.
# The 1st cell specifies the DMAC channel to be used for the data transfer.
#   This channel should be unique between all peripherals that are using the
#   DMAC instance.
# The 2nd cell defines the peripheral trigger which is the source of the transfer.
#   For details on trigger selection and trigger modes, refer to
#   "Transfer Triggers and Actions".
#   See the SoC's reference manual for all the supported request sources.
#
# Example of devicetree dma channel configuration:
#
# &sercom3 {
#     /* Configure DMA channels for async operation */
#     dmas = <&dmac 10 7>, <&dmac 11 8>;
#     dma-names = "rx", "tx";
# };
#
# In above fragment 10 and 11 represents the different channels used to
# transfer data between peripheral and ram. The numbers 7/8 are, for instance,
# uart_rx/tx peripheral trigger for sercom3.
