include: [eeprom-base.yaml, pinctrl-device.yaml]

properties:
  reg:
    required: true

  interrupts:
    required: true

  page-size:
    type: int
    default: 32
    description: |
      Internal EEPROM page size in bytes. Reads may cross page boundaries.
      Writes can be up to a page size but cannot cross a page boundary.

  page-read-time-ms:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      Page read time in microseconds.

  write-time-ms:
    type: int
    default: 5
    description: |
      Write (erase-program) timing of any size(1 byte to page size)
      in milliseconds.

  lock-password:
    type: int
    description: |
      Optional 31-bit password used to lock/unlock the EEPROM.
      If property is present the driver will write this value
      to the EEPROM controller lock register during driver
      initialization.

  lock-jtag-active:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Lock the EEPROM controller if JTAG/SWD debug interface is active.
      This overrides the normal lock/unlock feature.
