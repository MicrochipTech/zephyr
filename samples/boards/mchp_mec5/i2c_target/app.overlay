 * MEC5_ASSY6941
 * JP7 2-3 GPIO055 pulled-down via 10K to ground.
 * JP23 14-15 selects GPIO055 as SHD_nCS0
 * JP42 1-2 connects 1.8V
 * JP60 2-3 VTR2 is powered by 1.8V
 * NOTE: VTR3 is always 1.8V
 *
 * Boot-ROM GPIO055 as RSMRST#
 * GPIO Control register value = 0x0200
 * Output, push-pull, driver low, no internal pulls,
 * interrupt detection = level low, alternate out enabled.
 * ROM drives pin high(inactive) using alternate out (bit[16] of control register)
 * Control register = 0x10200
 *
 * GPIO175/CMP_VOUT1/PWM8_ALT on schematic, LED4 on silkscreen.
 *
 * I2C00_SDA/SCL = GPIO003/004
 * Install Jumper JP15 4-5 to route GPIO004 as I2C00_SCL/UART2_DCD
 * Install Jumper JP15 7-8 to route GPIO003 as I2C00_SDA/UART2_RI
 * Install Jumper JP27 34-35 to select I2C00_SDA
 * Install Jumper JP27 31-32 to select I2C00_SCL
 * Install Jumper JP70 19-20 7.5K pull-up to VTR1 for I2C00_SDA
 * Install Jumper JP70 21-22 7.5K pull-up to VTR1 for I2C00_SCL
 *
 * U4 is PCA9555 I2C GPIO expander
 * JP52 1-2 use +3.3V_STBY
 * JP61 1-2, 3-4 connect I2C00_SCL and I2C00_SDA to EXTERNAL_SCLK/SDATA
 * JP55 selects I2C address
 * 1-2 = A0, 3-4 = A1, 5-6 = A2 all pull-up by default. Install jumper to ground signals.
 * Installed jumper on JP55 1-2. I2C Address = 0x26
 *
 * U19 is LTC2489 I2C 4-channel delta-sigma ADC
 * Address select pins CA0, CA1 both pulled high. Install jumpers to ground signals.
 * Installed jumpers on JP124 1-2 and 3-4. I2C Address = 0x34
 *
 * Attached Fujitsu MB85RC256V I2C FRAM demo board to 6-pin header J17
 * AdaFruit I2C FRAM breakout board.
 * NOTE: removed demo board 1K pulls on SCL and SDA. Using EVB pulls on SCL/SDA.
 * This device allows testing of larger I2C messages and breaking up large transactions
 * into multiple message buffers.
 * FRAM board power -> J17-5 VTR1 (3.3V)
 * FRAM board GND   -> J17-6 GND
 * FRAM board SCL   -> J17-1 I2C00_SCL
 * FRAM board SDA   -> J17-3 I2C00_SDA
 * FRAM address pins A0, A1, A2 are internally pulled-down.
 * I2C Address = 1010_A2_A1_A0 = 0x50 (default)
 *
 * JP20 3x4 SPI1 signal demux
 *  1-2 GPIO144 I2C04_SCL
 *  4-5 GPIO143 I2C04_SDA
 *
 * JP21 3x16
 *  13-14 GPIO144 I2C04_SCL
 *  25-26 GPIO143 I2C04_SDA
 *
 * pull-ups
 * JP71 25-26 connect 7.5K pull-up to VTR1
 * JP71 27-28 connect 7.5K pull-up to VTR1
 *
 * I2C Port 4 is on VTR1. 1x6 header J17
 * 1 = I2C04_SCL
 * 2, 6 = GND
 * 3 = I2C04_SDA
 * 4 = NC
 * 5 = VTR1
 *
 * I2C Port 0 is on VTR1. 1x6 header J12
 * 1 = I2C00_SCL
 * 2, 6 = GND
 * 3 = I2C00_SDA
 * 4 = NC
 * 5 = VTR1
 *
 * Use I2C00 port on I2C00 device as external Controller
 * Use I2C04 port on I2C01 device as target
 * Add wires:
 * J17-1 to J12-1
 * J17-3 to J12-3
 * Disable pull-ups on I2C00 port:
 * Remove jumpers JP70 19-20 and 21-22
