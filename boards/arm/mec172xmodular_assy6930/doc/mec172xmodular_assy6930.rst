Connections and IOs
===================

This evaluation board kit is comprised of the following HW blocks:

- MEC172x Modular ASSY 6930 Rev A1 `MEC172x Modular EC Card - Assy_6930 Rev A0p1`_

System Clock
============

The MEC172x MCU is configured to use the 96Mhz internal oscillator with the
on-chip PLL to generate a resulting EC clock rate of 12 MHz. See Processor clock
control register in chapter 4 "4.0 POWER, CLOCKS, and RESETS" of the data sheet in
the references at the end of this document.

System Clock
============

The MEC172x MCU is configured to use the 48Mhz internal oscillator with the
on-chip PLL to generate a resulting EC clock rate of 12 MHz. See Processor clock
control register in chapter 4 "4.0 POWER, CLOCKS, and RESETS" of the data sheet in
the references at the end of this document.

Serial Port
===========

UART1 is configured for serial logs.


Jumper settings
***************

Please follow the jumper settings below to properly demo this
board. Advanced users may deviate from this recommendation.

Jumper setting for MEC172x Modular Assy 6930 Rev A1p0
=====================================================

Power-Related Jumpers
---------------------
If you wish to power from type A/B connector ``P1`` set the jumper ``JP22 1-2``.  This is required for standalone mode. 

If you wish to power through MECC connector ``P2`` and mate to external platform, set the jumper to ``JP22 3-4``.

.. note:: A single jumper is required in JP22.


Reest Jumper
------------
This jumper configures nRESET_IN.  When jumper is present, EC would be held in reset.

+---------------------+
| JP17 (nRESET_IN)    |
+=====================+
| 1-2                 |
+---------------------+

Boot-ROM Straps
---------------
This jumper configures MEC172x Boot-ROM strap. 

+---------------------+
| JP23 (UART_BSTRAP)  |
+=====================+
| 1-2                 |
+---------------------+
``JP23 1-2`` pulls UART_BSTRAP to GND.  MEC172x Boot-ROM samples UART_BSTRAP and if low, UART interface is used for Crisis Recovery. 


Programming and Debugging
*************************

Setup
=====
#. If you use Dediprog SF100 programmer, then setup it.

   Windows version can be found at the `SF100 Product page`_.

   Linux version source code can be found at `SF100 Linux GitHub`_.
   Follow the `SF100 Linux manual`_ to complete setup of the SF100 programmer.
   For Linux please make sure that you copied ``60-dediprog.rules``
   from the ``SF100Linux`` folder to the :code:`/etc/udev/rules.s` (or rules.d)
   then restart service using:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ udevadm control --reload

   Add directory with program ``dpcmd`` (on Linux)
   or ``dpcmd.exe`` (on Windows) to your ``PATH``.

#. Clone the `MEC172x SPI Image Gen`_ repository or download the files within
   that directory.

#. Make the image generation available for Zephyr, by making the tool
   searchable by path, or by setting an environment variable
   ``MEC172X_SPI_GEN``, for example:

   .. code-block:: console

      export MEC172X_SPI_GEN=<path to tool>/mec172x_spi_gen_lin_x86_64

   Note that the tools for Linux and Windows have different file names.

#. If needed, a custom SPI image configuration file can be specified
   to override the default one.

   .. code-block:: console

      export MEC172X_SPI_CFG=custom_spi_cfg.txt
 
Building
========
#. Build :ref:`hello_world` application as you would normally do.

#. The file :file:`spi_image.bin` will be created if the build system
   can find the image generation tool. This binary image can be used
   to flash the SPI chip.
  
Wiring
========
#. Connect Dediprog into header ``J2``. 
   It will flash the SPI NOR ``U2``.  Make sure that your programmer's offset is 0x0. For programming, you can use Dediprog SF100 or a similar tool for flashing SPI chips.

#. Apply power to the board via a micro-USB cable at ``P1``.
   Configure this option by using a jumper between ``JP22 1-2``.  This also serves as the UART1 COM port connection to Host computer.
     
Flashing
========
#. Run your favorite terminal program to listen for output.
   Under Linux the terminal should be :code:`/dev/ttyUSB0`. Do not close it.

   For example:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -o

   The -o option tells minicom not to send the modem initialization string. Connection should be configured as follows:

   - Speed: 115200
   - Data: 8 bits
   - Parity: None
   - Stop bits: 1

#. Flash your board using ``west`` from the second terminal window.
   Split first and second terminal windows to view both of them.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ west flash

   .. note:: When west process started press ``S1`` Reset button and do not release it
    till the whole west process finished successfully.  Alternately, you could load the 
    jumper at ''JP17 1-2'' when you program flash, and remove it when programming completed
	successfully.

#. You should see ``"Hello World! mec172xevb_assy6906"`` in the first terminal window.
   If you don't see this message, press the Reset button and the message should appear.

Debugging
=========
This board comes with a Cortex ETM port which facilitates tracing and debugging
using a single physical connection.  In addition, it comes with sockets for
JTAG only sessions.

Troubleshooting
===============
#. In case you don't see your application running, please make sure ``LED1`` is lit. 
   If ``LED1`` is off, check the power-related jumpers again.

#. If you can't program the board using Dediprog, disconnect and reconnect cable connected to 
   ``P1`` and try again.

#. If Dediprog can't detect the onboard flash, press the board's ``S1`` Reset button and try again.
